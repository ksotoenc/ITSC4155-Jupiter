# ITSC4155-Jupiter
Team Jupiter's Git Repository for ITSC4155 Spring 2025.

Registration Tracker is an application that allows students at UNCC to create and save graduation timelines or course planners through an intuitive and informative website. With our application, students can:

* Manage/edit their plans for graduation
* Handle errors in registration plans
* Store registration plans/graduation timelines in a database

Additionally, student advisors can:

* Provide students with feedback on created plans
* Suggest edits or new plans altogether

Our technologies used include Python, MySQL/SQLAlchemy for relational databases, and Streamlit as our front-end framework and server host.

Currently, the team is working on creating a simple front-end with Streamlit as well as our database/schema to display a student's pre-made graduation plan
